Precious Alexieane,

The reception of your letter has affected me in the most pleassant manner.
I began to write back immediatlely, before I even breawed myself a cup of
coffee. I am delighted to hear -or rather to read, i suppose- that you and
dear Armelle are spending a joyous lockdown.
On my side, life is acceptable. In contrast with you, space has become an
issue: with only two rooms for 3 people I often fail in finding privacy.
Because the general landscape of Colombes is ugly , and since mankind
seems to have forgotten about the good, simple practice of wearing masks, I
find solace in the morn.
I wake up early (I know, how surprising) just to have the living room to
myself and catch a moment of peace. I use this time to practice some yoga,
and work on my project. Living the true proletarian experience, I cook for us all
-not that it is required by others, but because their cuisine fucking sucks-


PS: has my friend Pal reached your domain yet? He is my courrier whom i've tasked with escorting
your money back to you in a haste.
